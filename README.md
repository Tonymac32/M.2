# M.2

This repo, wiki, and issues/discussions are a collection of the current implementations of M.2 form factor for use as microcontrollers and modules started from a [Twitter discussion](https://twitter.com/zs/status/1319691639586082816).

What is M.2?

> M.2, formerly known as the Next Generation Form Factor (NGFF), is a specification for internally mounted computer expansion cards and associated connectors. M.2 replaces the mSATA standard, which uses the PCI Express Mini Card physical card layout and connectors. Employing a more flexible physical specification, the M.2 allows different module widths and lengths, and, paired with the availability of more advanced interfacing features, makes the M.2 more suitable than mSATA in general for solid-state storage applications, and particularly in smaller devices such as ultrabooks and tablets - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M.2).
